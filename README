This is sample AI code for ORTS

build with:

  make sampleai

test with:

  bin/orts -marines -n_marines 50 -nplayers 2 -sdelay 8

  bin/sampleai -usegfx   (in another terminal window)

  bin/sampleai           (in another terminal window)

This creates a map with many marines shooting at each other
and running around randomly. The first command starts a sample AI
using the 3D OpenGL client for a display; use the '-disp' option 
instead of '-usegfx' for the 2D client.
